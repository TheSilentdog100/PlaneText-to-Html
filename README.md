#PlaneText-to-Html  
  
This is a small script i use to convert Plane Text into blog entries.  
Before running Blog_Reader.py make sure you ran create_config.py  
This script will allow you to either create a new ouput file  
with the text converted to html or to just print the html code  
in the terminal.
